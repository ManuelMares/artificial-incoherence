# GIT LFS FOR DATA SETS
Due to the size of the involved data sets, it is recommended to work with Git large data sets library. You can install it
by running the following command 'git lfs install' and keeping track of the .gitattributes file.

# Description
This is the repo of Artificial Incoherence for the Data Mining class.
To read the proposal, check the 'Project Proposal' (pdf or docxs).

# Schedule
This schedule is just a suggestion
week 1 & 2:
	Data collection. 
We will investigate the different available data sources to have the information as complete as possible

week 3 :
	Data exploration. 
We will analyze the different data sources, we will clean them, normalize them, and will find correlation patterns to create an argument for our research.

week 4,5.
Experimentation.
We will test different approaches, such as different algorithms, different configurations, different visualization methods, etc., to try to determine the most effective methods.

week 6,7. 
	Improvement
Having determined the most effective approach, we will further experiment with its parameter to try to better approximate our model.

week 8,9. 
	Analysis of results
We will analyze our results to try to provide valuable conclusions, as well as produce a systematic report of our approach, limitations and observations.


# Requirements
Python ^2.7. You can either install Python in your computer or set an environment with Anacoda
This project is expected to be run in VSCode

# Working with interactive cells
In order to visualize the the plots, you need to use interactive cells just like the ones in Jupyter Notebook or in Google Collab.
## Create a new cell
add the following comment on top your code to run: '#%%'
## To run the interactive cell
Right above the comment, three buttons will appear. Select 'run', and a new window will appear with your results
## running the whole project in the interactive window
You can running the whole project at once with the rop right buttons, or by right-clicking the document and choosing to run the interactive window. 
The adventage of using cells is not having to process the models all over again every time you do a light modification that does not involve previous steps
